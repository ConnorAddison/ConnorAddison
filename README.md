Hi! I'm Connor Addison.

This is just a brief project I threw together to share a little about myself as a software engineer/human. ðŸ¤ 

Feel free to check it out [here](https://connoraddison.github.io/ConnorAddison/). ðŸ”ŒðŸ“ 

I've already done several independent projects, and I am learning more and more about software engineering at lightspeed! ðŸ’« After my first year of learning, I am already proficient in HTML, CSS, GitHub, Git Bash, JavaScript, Figma, VS code, and more! ðŸ¦¾

Feel free to check out my projects I've done in these mediums, you can find them all on my GitHub projects page. More are on the way. ðŸ«€ðŸ’•ðŸ˜¹

The program I am enrolled in to learn all this is called TripleTen. Feel free to ask me about it. It's the top software engineer career program in the world!

I've actually had my software engineer friends comment on how much more focused and relevant it is to the industry than the content you learn in university when you major in it!
